All rights belong to its respective authors (Greg Perry and Dean Miller) and publisher QUE. The meaning of this repo is to
provide readers and students with a single interactive console as they follow along with the book. The original source files have
been kept mostly intact under the rewritten_code directory (with the exception of removed or corrected warnings/errors). 

This program uses an array of function pointers to allow each example of the book to be called by the user on-demand. This allows
the student/reader to view the output of each example and to set breakpoints, etc., in their IDE as they step through the examples.
